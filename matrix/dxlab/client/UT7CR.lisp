of course), ‘Why yet another book on Common Lisp, when there are many nice
introductory books?’ One year later, I found a draft of the new book and recog-
nized I was wrong. This book is not ‘yet another’ one. The author focuses on
practical aspects rather than on technical details of the language. When I first
studied Lisp by reading an introductory book, I felt I understood the language,
but I also had the impression, ‘so what?’—meaning I had no idea about how to
use it. In contrast, this book leaps into a ‘practical’ chapter after the first few
chapters that explains the very basic notions of the language. Then the readers
are expected to learn more about the language while they are following the
‘practical’ projects, which are combined to form a product of significant size.
After reading this book, the readers will feel they are expert programmers on
Common Lisp since they have ‘finished’ a big project already. I think Lisp is the
only language that allows this type of practical introduction. Peter makes use
of this feature of the language in building up a fancy introduction to Common
Lisp.” —Taiichi Yuasa, Professor, Department of Communications and

  "■Barry Margolin taught himself computer programming in high school in the late ’70s, first on DEC PDP-8 time-sharing systems and then on Radio Shack TRS-80 personal computers, and he learned operating system design by reverse engineering these systems. He went to M.I.T., where he learned Lisp programming from Bernie Greenberg, author of the Multics MacLisp Compiler and Multics Emacs (the first Emacs clone to be written in Lisp); David Moon (one of the implementers of ITS Maclisp and a founder of Symbolics); and Alan Bawden (perhaps one of the best Lisp macrologists). After getting his computer science degree, he went to work for the Honeywell Multics development group, maintaining Emacs. When Honeywell discontinued
Multics development, he went to Thinking Machines Corporation to maintain their Lisp Machine development environment. Since then, he has worked for Bolt, Beranek, and Newman—which became BBN Planet, then GTE Internetworking, and then Genuity, until being acquired by Level(3)—providing technical support for their Internet services. He’s now working for Symantec providing level-two customer technical support for its enterprise firewall products."

Barry Margolin, who has been providing tidbits of Lisp history and his own brand of quiet wisdom for as long as I’ve been reading the group; and Kent Pitman, who, in addition to having been one of the principal technical editors of the language standard and the author of the Common Lisp HyperSpec, has written hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of words in comp.lang.lisp postings elucidating various aspects of the language and how it came to be."
